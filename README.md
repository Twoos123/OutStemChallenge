This is my submission for the OutStem front-end challenge

Goals achieved:

Goal 1: Fetch an easy, true/false, general knowledge question from the API, and print the response to the console

Goal 2: Instead of printing to the console, display the question to the user, and allow them to select between the true and false options using whichever UI elements you think are best suited.

Goal 3: If the user choses the correct answer, give them a success message, and the option to move on to the next stage of the game, If they chose the incorrect answer, give them a failure message including what the correct answer was, and have them restart the game.

Goal 4: Now fetch an easy multiple choice question from the general knowledge category. Display the question on the screen for the user, and allow them to select their answer with whichever UI elements you think are best suited.

Goal 5: If the user choses the correct answer, give them a success message, and the option to move on to the next stage of the game. If they chose the incorrect answer, give them a failure message including what the correct answer was, and have them restart the game.

Goal 6: Repeat with goals 1-5 with medium, and then hard questions
